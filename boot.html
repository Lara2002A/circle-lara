            <p> One of the themes i found most interesting in the reading, and as a theme we’ve been discussing in general in code situated within the liberal arts, is the interaction between the computer and the human. Bardini introduces Engelbart’s idea of 5 types of structures: mental structures, concept structures, symbol structures, process structures and physical structures. Although I didn’t 100% comprehend the details and nuances of each structure, it seems to me that from the way he broadly defines them– mental structures as the organization in the human mind, concept structures as the communicable, transferable, and reflexive/adaptive structures that can be expressed and impressed from/on the human mind, symbol structures as the representation of the expressed concept structures, process structures as the augmenting mechanisms that link these structures together in certain ways, and physical structures as the physical artefact with an emphasis on its physical mechanism and construction– he is establishing the structures to communicate the way that components from the human to the computer side interact with each other. We’ve discussed human-computer interaction as the interface, the mouse/keyboard/keyset, and I learnt about google search results for my paper which also function based on a strong interlinking between user and computer. I think these structures are a very interesting vocabulary to add to this language around human-computer interactions, especially when discussing the way humans affect computers as well as the ways computers affect humans or when both exist simultaneously and/or because of each other, for example, biased technology like algorithms that are built on discrimination and human biases and consequently perpetuate discrimination to/within the end users based on the skewed results, as an example of concept structures affecting mental and symbol/physical structures by being expressed from human to computer and impressed from computer onto human. </p>
