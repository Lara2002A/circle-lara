    <h1>Congratulations!
        You reach a clearing in the forest, luminous with moonlight...
        Lounging there, seemingly waiting for you, is a baby LuneDragon!
        These rare creatures separate from their parents early in life...and love to be taken as pets!
        It clearly needs a loving home and you are happy to provide!</h1>
